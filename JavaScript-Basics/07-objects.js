//Object Literals

//1         //2
let zelda = {
    //3                     //4
    name                :  "Zelda",
    age                 :  17,
    title               :  "Princess",
    isCaptured          :  true 
}

console.log(zelda); //1
console.log(zelda.name); //2
console.log(zelda.age); //3

//1. Prints the whole object
//2. Prints the value of the name property.
//3. Prints the value of the age property.

//Undefined

console.log(zelda.middleName); //undefined: middleName does not exist

//Practice and Understanding
//1. console.log the value of title from the Zelda object using dot notation.
console.log(zelda.title);
//2. Do the same as above for isCaptured
console.log(zelda.isCaptured);
//3. Create another object named player.
let link = {
    name                :  "link",
    age                 :  17,
    title               :  "Hero",
    isCaptured          :  false 
}
//Add properties named , , and .
Assign values for each property.
Display the player's .
More Practice
Make more s. Work on getting the syntax and have fun. Use the prompts below or make your own in order to create at least 3 more objects.

Make a friend with at least four properties.
Make another called movie with three properties
Make an about anything you want (recipe, car, sports team etc).
