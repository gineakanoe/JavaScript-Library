Step 1: Making the circle

   - First div tag has the class wrapper. This div will wrap around all of the steps we add.
    - After the wrapping div, we have an h1 tag with the contents of CSS Smiley Face. This will be the title at the top of the page and we'll only have to type it once.
    - We also added an h2 tag with the contents of Step 1: Make the circle. We will add an h2 tag for each step we add.
    - Last we added a div with the class face. Notice there is nothing between the opening and closing tags. We will modify this class with CSS next.

Step 1-b: In CSS

    - We added a margin of 5 pixels to our wrapper class to move it away from edges a little further.
    - We are adding quite a few things to our face class. This will style that empty div that we added with the face class.

Step 2: Adding Left Eye

    - Notice we left the previous step alone. We'll be making a new face for each step.
    - Here we added a new h2 tag with Add the left eye to notate the new step along with another div with the class face.
    - Inside the face div, we have another div with the class lefteye.
    - Also make sure all of our steps stay inside of the wrapper div.

Step 3: Adding Right Eye

    - Again we left the previous step alone and added our new one.
    - Notice that we put our lefteye and righteye divs independently inside the face.
    - Make sure all of our steps stay inside of the wrapper div.

Step 4: Adding the mouth

    - You know the drill. New step after the last one but still inside the wrapper div.

Step 5: Adding the inner eyes

    - Notice here we're putting the inner eye divs inside of their respective eye div. Why do you think that is?

Step 6: Challenge

    - Take some time to see if you can add some additional features.
    - Maybe add a goatee, eyebrows, a tongue, etc.
