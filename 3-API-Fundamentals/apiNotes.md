ASYNCHRONUS PROGRAMMING

- Asynchronus programming allows a program to do more than on thing at a time
- If the case of fetching data from an outside source like we da with an API, if JS did not have the ability to run code asynchronously, it would have to run each line of code, wait for the response from the API, and then finish running the rest of the code.

-API - Application Programming Interface - 

CALLBACKS
-Callbacks, or callback functions, are functions that get executed at the conclusion of an async process

PROMISE
-A promise is an object that may produce a singular value in the future 
-Promises have three states:
    -pending: undefined result
    -fulfilled: returns a value/result
    -rejected: returns an error object/result
